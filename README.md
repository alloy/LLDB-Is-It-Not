# You want to load your project specific settings for LLDB, init?

This Xcode plugin will look in the source root of your project (where you keep your xcworkspace or xcodeproj) for a
`.lldbinit` file and load it.

Thatâ€™s it.

### Install

Open the Xcode project, perform the build command, and restart Xcode.
